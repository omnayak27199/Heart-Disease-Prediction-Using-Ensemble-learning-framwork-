# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Ensemble-learning-framwork-
Nowadays cardiovascular disease is amidst of the leading ten sources for the growing rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting roughly 50% of the adult age group in the health care sector. Heart disease claims the lives of about one person per minute in this modern era. Accurate detection methods for the timely identification of cardiovascular disorders are essential because there is rapid growth in the number of patients with this disease. The dataset contains quantitative and structured data on heart disease indicators in patients. Our goal is to understand risk factors by analyzing the dataset using exploratory data analysis. Heart disease is a long-term problem with a greater risk of becoming worse over time. In this paper, one of the ensemble learning techniques soft voting was used for the identification of disease and it achieved an accuracy of 90.21%.
